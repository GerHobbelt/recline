<h4>Selection Actions - onHover</h4>
<p>
This example uses three models, each with different data but a common field.<br>
Then there's a listbox that is populated with the common field, and two slickgrids that are populated with the other two models.<br>
Whenever the user selects an item from the listbox, the slickgrids react accordingly, selecting the matching rows.
