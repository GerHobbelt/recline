<h4>Model with CSV backend</h4>
<p>When using a CSV file as data source, it's important to specify the
exact field type in advance, since CSV doesn't store this piece of
information with the data (like JSON, instead, does).</p>
<p>This must be accomplished by using "fieldsType" option. Any field that's not listed
inside this option will be treated as a string by default.</p>
<p>Failing in doing so may cause your page to exhibit incorrect behaviour.</p>
