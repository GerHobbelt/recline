<h4>Filtered model</h4>
<p>
In this example there are two models:<br>
- a main Dataset<br> 
- a FilteredDataset that inherits completely the contents from the previous one<br>
<br>
The light-grey section shows the main dataset and allows filtering by age range only.<br>
The light-yellow section shows the filtered dataset and allows filtering by country and gender (but not by age).<br>
<br>
It's easy to notice that, whenever a filter is applied to the main dataset, also the inheriting FilteredDataset is affected.<br>
However, filtering the FilteredDataset in the light-yellow section doesn' affect the main Dataset in the top section.
