<h4>Virtual model: partition</h4>
<p>
This example uses a model (visible in the top table) and manipulates it with a virtual model, providing horizontal field expansion based on a field's contents.<br>
The virtual model has:<br>
<ul>
<li>Two aggregation dimensions ("country" and "gender", that are used by the "groupBy")</li>
<li>Two aggregation functions ("sum" and "avg", that will be applied to the measures)</li>
<li>Two aggregation measures ("age" and "visits", that will be computed with the functions above once grouped)</li>
</ul>
The resulting virtual model contents are visible in the bottom table
